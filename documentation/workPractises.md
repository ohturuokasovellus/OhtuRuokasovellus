# Dev Team Work Practices

+ Pull requests should be reviewed and approved by someone who has not work on the branch
+ If a feature requires documentation, add it to the documentation directory.
+ Use expressive variable names to make the code easier to read for everyone
+ Do not rename files/directories without informing everyone â€“ if you do, remember to check all imports nd references too!
+ Check that the packages you install are supported in React Native.
+ Check linting before making a pull request.
